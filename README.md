This project contains my attempt to understand nodejs asynchronous workings.

Following patterns are to be learned
1. Events
2. Async.JS
3. Promises
    -Bluebird

All excercises must be modular and include at least 2 files.
First file contains a function call defined in another file.
Function must take 1 parameter and it needs to call an async function.
